# Weather for You

This React application allows users to check the current weather by entering either a city name or a pincode. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the provided city name. If a pincode is entered, it first fetches the corresponding city name using the Google Maps Geocoding API and then retrieves weather information. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>



2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd <project_directory>

3. Install dependencies:
npm install

4. Set up environment variables:
- Get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace `'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY'` with your API key in the `getWeather()` function.
- Get an API key from [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) and replace `'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY'` with your API key in the `getWeatherByPincode()` function.

5. Run the application:
npm start


## Usage

1. Enter a city name in the input field and click "Get Weather" to fetch the weather details for the specified city.
2. Alternatively, enter a pincode in the input field and click "Get Weather" to retrieve the weather information based on the corresponding city.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- useState Hook for managing component state
- Fetch API for making HTTP requests
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
- Google Maps Geocoding API for converting pincode to city name
